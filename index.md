# Introduction

Hello there, my name is Paul Anzel! I'm a Data Scientist currently employed with [Metromile](https://www.metromile.com/) where I use telematics data to detect vehicle crashes and evaluate potential insurance fraud. Before that, I worked at [Wiser](https://www.wiser.com/) doing price-demand estimation.

I did doctoral research in Applied Physics at Caltech with [Chiara Daraio](http://daraio.caltech.edu/) (left ABD). During my graduate research, I recieved a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship and a M.S. in Applied Physics. I have a B.S. and B.A. in Chemical Physics and Mathematics (respectively) from Rice University.

Outside of work, I spends much of my time advocating for housing with [East Bay For Everyone](https://eastbayforeveryone.org/) and will talk your ear off about California housing politics if asked. I managed Caltech's [bicycle repair cooperative](https://caltechbikelab.blogspot.com/) for three years, play accordion and piano, and have started getting into ham radio.

I live with my lovely wife Rose, infant son Isaac, and fussy cat Coltrane.

# Some projects

## [Statistics Study Group Notes](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week)

During my time at Wiser, I started a journal club to go over some techniques I wanted to learn more about and to teach some of the other analysts some basic techniques (e.g. what a Fourier transform was). This is a collection of iPython notebooks where I went through implementing the algorithms myself and demonstrated their use.

Some ones I'm particularly proud of:
- [The Hilbert and Hilbert-Huang Transform](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Hilbert_Transform.ipynb)
- [HOT-SAX for discord discovery](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/HOT_SAX.ipynb)
- [Robust outlier detection techniques](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Grubbs_and_Qtest.ipynb)

## [Domestic Violence Program mapping](https://github.com/anzelpwj/DV_program_analysis)

Mapping and basic analysis of domestic violence programs in the Los Angeles area done for Jordana Siracusa.

## [The Science(?) of Documentation, WriteTheDocs 2017](https://github.com/anzelpwj/writethedocs2017)

Inspired by [Greg Wilson's commentary](http://third-bit.com/talks/greatest-hits/#/) that the state of software-development research is thin and poorly distributed on the ground, I did some research on my own looking into what research there is regarding software documentation. Long-story short, there's precious little. I attended the WTD conference to see if I could get any more, and ended up giving a little presentation about how little we know and how to assess relevant scientific evidence.
